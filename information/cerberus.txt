Cerberus serves as a "messenger" program that is able to alert a hypothetical command center 
when any on-ground cases happen.

Security Companies typically have standard operating procedures when it comes to critical security scenarios.
These standard operating procedures would involve some sort of information passing down a chain-of-command, such that
when a situation does occur, a localised unit/team would be informed of it, and is able to respond effectively.

The process of this information passing is traditionally manual in nature - it requires some individual to be able to discern an escalation of an interaction,
and then notify their respective superiors. 

This is where Cerberus provides value. The intention of Cerberus is to be able to monitor live situations automatically, and be able to discern,
on some level, whether or not a siutation will escalate to a level that requires specific attention.
