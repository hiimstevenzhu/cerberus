False Alarms are a big problem for Cerberus to tackle, as we want to ensure that we capture as accurately as possible,

- Using NLP to extract keywords out of the next to parse to a GPT to determine severity(Overkill?)
- Using sentiment analysis as a base filter to ensure that some hostility exists(?)
- ** To explore ** Recognising tone
